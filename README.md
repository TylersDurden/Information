This project is all about trying to understand how we use computer to reprsent
media and information. 

## Polyglots - polyglotten.py
Polyglots in programming are often files that can be read as multiple different formats, compiled into different
programs/applications, or something transferible between multiple fileformats with varying degrees of mutation. 

Seeing the various ways the PDF was abused in PoC||GTFO, I was fascinated with this digital black magic. 
Thinking to myself I wondered aloud in my cubicle, and at my dinner table about this voodoo. The power of
PDF Polyglots lies in the abuse of object streams, and the ability to point this generically to just about anything
that can fit in a PDF header. 

Streams, Neighbor. The torrent of bytes opened in processing. Fragile is the processor set aloft via skillful header
manipulation... but what of useful Polyglots?! Could this misdirection of byte streaming be not instead directed
towards accelerating program speed! Couldn't the Polyglot instead be used for efficiently obfuscating and processing the code of Good Bits? 

Polyglottony (Adj.) : The saturation of ones attention with the unpatchable mystery of the Polyglot File. 

## Remotely 
Experimenting with scripting to and from hosts. Using a raspberry pi [that I own!] for this. Example of getting root:
